We would like to recommend movies that a user would actually watch based upon what they and others have liked - we don't want to provide a rating between 1 and 5 for every movie in the data set!  Hence, we're going to use **pandas** to drop any reviews that are not > 3.6, and once we've done that also drop the review column - we're left with a subset of the original that contain 4- and 5-star ratings, which is basically indicating movies that the user really liked.  Of course, we could use all of the data, but this would lead to far greater data import and model training time.\n",

Some of the Amazon Personalize recipies react differently depending upon the age of the interactions - for instance, the _Similar Items_ recipe has several hyperparameters around how to handle 'decaying' interactions.  In order to make this lab easier, and not have to worry about these hyperparameters, we are shifting all of the review timestamps to be from August 2018 up until April 2019.\n",

This file is known in Amazon Personalize as an **Interactions** data file.  Other data files are usable, such as ones that define additional metadata about the movies (such as year and genre) and another that defines demographic data about the user (such as age, gender and location).  In this lab we do not need them, but this information is available in the Movie Lens data set files that you have downloaded - you can create your own models based upon those at a later date."
